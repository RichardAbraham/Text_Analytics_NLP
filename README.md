# Summary
Stan Lee, one of Americas most prolific comic book writers, died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-five on November 12, 2018. This aims to analyze social media's response, particularly Twitter, to his life around and after his death. The goal is to explore the tweets to reveal interesting insights about Stan Lee and his work. In addition, the goal is also to build a ML model that is capable of accurately classifyig the sentiment of a tweet.

# Motivation
Stan Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business to become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics industry.

In collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writer/artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created numerous popular fictional characters, including superheroes Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man. In doing so, he pioneered a more naturalistic approach to writing superhero comics in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies.

Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.

As a Marvel fan myself, I wanted to explore his life and work in greater detail using machine learning! I intended on utilizing various NLP techniques to shape the data and buld a model that would accurately classify the sentiment of a tweet. In the process, I also wanted to reveal insights about his life and work that many may not be aware of.
